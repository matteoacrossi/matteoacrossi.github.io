	Abstract = {Continuous-time quantum walks may be exploited to enhance spatial search, i.e., for finding a marked element in a database structured as a complex network. However, in practical implementations, the environmental noise has detrimental effects, and a question arises on whether noise engineering may be helpful in mitigating those effects on the performance of the quantum algorithm. Here we study whether time-correlated noise inducing non-Markovianity may represent a resource for quantum search. In particular, we consider quantum search on a star graph, which has been proven to be optimal in the noiseless case, and analyze the effects of independent random telegraph noise (RTN) disturbing each link of the graph. Upon exploiting an exact code for the noisy dynamics, we evaluate the quantum non-Markovianity of the evolution, and show that it cannot be considered as a resource for this algorithm, since its presence is correlated with lower probabilities of success of the search.},

@article{Cattaneo2018,
	Abstract = {We address quantum spatial search on graphs and its implementation by continuous-time quantum walks in the presence of dynamical noise. In particular, we focus on search on the complete graph and on the star graph of order {\$}N{\$}, proving that also the latter is optimal in the computational limit {\$}N \backslashgg 1{\$}, being nearly optimal also for small {\$}N{\$}. The noise is modeled by independent sources of random telegraph noise (RTN), dynamically perturbing the links of the graph. We observe two different behaviours depending on the switching rate of RTN: fast noise only slightly degrades performance, whereas slow noise is more detrimental and, in general, lowers the success probability. In particular, we still find a quadratic speed-up for the average running time of the algorithm, while for the star graph with external target node we observe a transition to classical scaling. We also address how the effects of noise depend on the order of the graphs, and discuss the role of the graph topology. Overall, our results suggest that realizations of quantum spatial search are possible with current technology, and also indicate the star graph as the perfect candidate for the implementation by noisy quantum walks, owing to its simple topology and nearly optimal performance also for just few nodes.},

	Abstract = {We consider the estimation of a weak magnetic field B acting on a continuously monitored ensemble of atoms subjected to collective transverse noise. If N atoms are prepared in a coherent spin state and are not continuously monitored, the estimation precision scales with the total number of atoms according to the standard quantum limit {\$}{\$}$\backslash$delta B{\^{}}2 $\backslash$sim 1/N{\$}{\$}. Remarkably, time-continuous monitoring of light that is coupled with the atomic ensemble, allows to achieve a Heisenberg limited precision {\$}{\$}$\backslash$delta B{\^{}}2 $\backslash$sim 1/N{\^{}}2{\$}{\$}. However this is typically obtained only for a large enough number of atoms N and with an asymptotic constant factor depending on the parameters characterizing the experiment. In this proceeding, after reviewing the analytical derivation of the effective quantum Fisher information that quantifies the ultimate precision achievable, we specifically address the role played by monitoring time and detectors measurement efficiency in obtaining a Heisenberg limited scaling. In particular we analyze the dependence on these experimentally relevant parameters of the asymptotic constant factor characterizing the effective quantum Fisher information, and, more importantly, the minimum value of atoms needed to observe the desired quantum enhancement.},

This setup can simulate in one shot the ensemble-averaged dynamics of the dephasing qubit.

	Abstract = {We address memory effects and diffusive properties of a continuous-time quantum walk on a one-dimensional percolation lattice affected by spatially correlated random telegraph noise. In particular, by introducing spatially correlated time-dependent fluctuations in nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes, we describe random domains characterized by global noise. The resulting open dynamics of the walker is then unraveled by an ensemble average over all the noise realizations. Our results show that time-dependent noise assisted by spatial correlations leads to strong memory effects in the walker dynamics and to robust diffusive behavior against the detrimental action of uncorrelated noise. We also show that spatially correlated classical noise enhances localization breaking, thus making a quantum particle spread on longer distances across the lattice.},

	Abstract = {We address the dynamics of a bosonic system coupled to either a bosonic or a magnetic environment and derive a set of sufficient conditions that allow one to describe the dynamics in terms of the effective interaction with a classical fluctuating field. We find that for short interaction times the dynamics of the open system is described by a Gaussian noise map for several different interaction models and independently on the temperature of the environment. In order to go beyond a qualitative understanding of the origin and physical meaning of the above short-time constraint, we take a general viewpoint and, based on an algebraic approach, suggest that any quantum environment can be described by classical fields whenever global symmetries lead to the definition of environmental operators that remain well defined when increasing the size, i.e., the number of dynamical variables, of the environment. In the case of the bosonic environment this statement is exactly demonstrated via a constructive procedure that explicitly shows why a large number of environmental dynamical variables and, necessarily, global symmetries, entail the set of conditions derived in the first part of the work.},

Here, we consider the possibility of continuously monitoring the atomic environment, and conclusively show that strategies based on time-continuous non-demolition measurements followed by a final strong measurement may achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling 1/J 2 and also a quantum-enhanced scaling in terms of the interrogation time.

	Abstract = {Should the Dicke model of light-matter interaction include a diamagnetic term? This question has generated intense debate in the literature, and is particularly relevant in the modern contexts of cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics. We design an appropriate probing strategy to address the issue experimentally. Applying the tools of quantum estimation theory to a general Dicke model, we quantify how much information about the diamagnetic term (or lack thereof) is contained in the ground state of the coupled system. We demonstrate that feasible measurements, such as homodyne detection or photon counting, give access to a significant fraction of such information. These measurements could be performed by suddenly switching off the light-matter coupling, and collecting the radiation that naturally leaks out of the system. We further show that, should the model admit a critical point, both measurements would become asymptotically optimal in its vicinity. We finally discuss binary discrimination strategies between the two most debated hypotheses involving the diamagnetic term.},

Upon exploiting the exact RTN solution of the time-dependent von Neumann equation, we analyze in detail the behavior of quantum correlations and prove the non-Markovianity of the dynamical map in the full parameter range, i.e., for either fast or slow noise. The dynamics induced by Gaussian noise is studied numerically and compared to the RTN solution, showing the existence of (state dependent) regions of the parameter space where the two noises lead to very similar dynamics. We show that the effects of RTN noise and of Gaussian noise are different, i.e., the spectrum alone is not enough to summarize the noise effects, but the dynamics under the effect of one kind of noise may be simulated with high fidelity by the other one.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Physical Society. {\textcopyright}2015 American Physical Society.We address the use of entangled qubits as quantum probes to characterize the noise induced by complex environments. In particular, we show that a joint measurement on entangled probes can improve estimation of the correlation time for a broad class of environmental noises compared to sequential strategies involving single-qubit preparation. The enhancement appears when the noise is faster than a threshold value, a regime which may always be achieved by tuning the coupling between the quantum probe and the environment inducing the noise. Our scheme exploits time-dependent sensitivity of quantum systems to decoherence and does not require dynamical control on the probes. We derive the optimal interaction time and the optimal probe preparation, showing that it corresponds to multiqubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states when entanglement is useful. We also show the robustness of the scheme against depolarization or dephasing of the probe, and discuss simple measurements approaching optimal precision.},

	Abstract = {We address the dynamics of a two-qubit system interacting with a classical dephasing environment driven by a Gaussian stochastic process. Upon introducing the concept of entanglement-preserving time, we compare the degrading effects of different environments, e.g. those described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or fractional noise. In particular, we consider pure Bell states and mixtures of Bell states and study the typical values of the entanglement-preserving time for both independent and common environments. We found that engineering environments towards fractional Gaussian noise is useful to preserve entanglement as well as to improve its robustness against noise. We also address entanglement sudden death by studying the entanglement-survival time as a function of the initial negativity. We found that: i) the survival time is bounded from below by an increasing function of the initial negativity, ii) the survival time depends only slightly on the process used to describe the environment and exhibits typicality. Overall, our results show that engineering the environment has only a slight influence over the entanglement-survival time, i.e. the occurence of entanglement sudden-death, while it represents a valuable resource to increase the entanglement-preserving time, i.e. to maintain entanglement closer to the initial level for a longer interaction time.},

	Abstract = {A usual assumption in quantum estimation is that the unknown parameter labels the possible states of the system, while it influences neither the sample space of outcomes nor the measurement aimed at extracting information on the parameter itself. This assumption is crucial to prove the quantum Cram$\backslash$'er-Rao theorem and to introduce the quantum Fisher information as an upper bound to the Fisher information of any possible measurement. However, there are relevant estimation problems where this assumption does not hold and an alternative approach should be developed to find the genuine ultimate bound to precision of quantum measurements. We investigate physical situations where there is an intrinsic dependence of the measurement strategy on the parameter and find that quantum-enhanced measurements may be more precise than previously thought.},

	Abstract = {Quantum gravity theories predict a minimal length at the order of magnitude of the Planck length, under which the concepts of space and time lose every physical meaning. In quantum mechanics, the insurgence of such minimal length can be described by introducing a modified position-momentum commutator, which in turn yields a generalized uncertainty principle, where the uncertainty on the position measurement has a lower bound. The value of the minimal length is not predicted by theories and must be evaluated experimentally. In this paper, we address the quantum bound to estimability of the minimal uncertainty length by performing measurements on a harmonic oscillator, which is analytically solvable in the deformed algebra of the Hilbert subspace.},

	Abstract = {We address the characterization of dissipative bosonic channels and show that estimation of the loss rate by Gaussian probes (coherent or squeezed) is improved in the presence of Kerr nonlinearity. In particular, enhancement of precision may be substantial for short interaction time, i.e. for media of moderate size, e.g. biological samples. We analyze in detail the behaviour of the quantum Fisher information (QFI), and determine the values of nonlinearity maximizing the QFI as a function of the interaction time and of the parameters of the input signal. We also discuss the precision achievable by photon counting and quadrature measurement and present additional results for truncated, few-photon, probe signals. Finally, we discuss the origin of the precision enhancement, showing that it cannot be linked quantitatively to the non-Gaussianity of the interacting probe signal.},
